Project Overview - Product Demand Analysis

**Project Name:** Product Demand Analysis

**Project Description:**
Product demand analysis is a data-driven project aimed at helping businesses better understand and predict the demand for their products. By combining machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and data visualization, this project offers valuable insights to support business decision-making.

**Key Objectives:**

1. **Demand Forecasting:** The project's primary goal is to accurately forecast product demand. This is essential for optimizing inventory, production, and distribution.

2. **Data Exploration:** The project involves exploring and cleaning historical sales data. This includes dealing with missing values, feature engineering, and data preprocessing.

3. **Clustering Analysis:** Clustering techniques such as K-Means clustering are applied to segment products into different categories based on their sales patterns. This helps in tailoring strategies for different product groups.

4. **Time Series Analysis:** The project uses time series analysis, specifically the ARIMA model, to capture seasonality and trends in product demand over time.

5. **Regression and Classification:** For different types of products, the project utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest Regression and Classification to predict and classify product demand. For example, it can predict the number of units sold for one product and classify stores based on their sales performance.

**Features:**

- **Data Visualization:** The project includes visualizations to represent historical sales data, predicted demand, and classification results. This helps users understand trends and make informed decisions.

- **Model Evaluation:** Machine learning models are evaluated using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for regression and classification reports to assess the performance of classification models.



**Benefits:**

- Accurate demand forecasting minimizes overstocking or understocking issues.
- Improved inventory management and cost optimization.
- Tailored marketing and sales strategies for different product categories.
- Enhanced data-driven decision-making for businesses.

This product demand analysis project equips businesses with the tools to make informed decisions, reduce costs, and meet customer demands effectively.
